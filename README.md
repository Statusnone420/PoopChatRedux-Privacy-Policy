**PoopChat.app**
**Effective date:** December 12, 2025

PoopChatRedux is a lightweight chat and humor app created by Anthony Gagliardo (“we”, “us”, or “our”).

## Information We Collect

PoopChatRedux does not require you to provide personal information such as your real name, email address, or phone number to use the app.

Messages, reactions, and GIF activity may be transmitted in real time to enable chat functionality. This data is used only to operate the core features of the app and is not sold or used for advertising.

PoopChatRedux does not collect sensitive personal data such as location, contacts, photos, or biometric information.

## Data Storage

Any locally generated app data (such as UI state or timers) is stored on your device using Apple system frameworks.

We do not intentionally retain personal data beyond what is necessary to operate the app’s chat features.

## Third-Party Services

PoopChatRedux uses third-party services only as required to provide functionality, such as:

* **GIF content providers** (e.g. GIPHY) to display animated GIFs
* **Apple services** for app distribution, diagnostics, and device-level storage

These services may process data according to their own privacy policies. We do not control how third-party services handle data once it is processed by them.

PoopChatRedux does not use third-party advertising networks or social login providers.

## Children

PoopChatRedux is intended for a general audience and is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When changes are made, the “Effective date” at the top of this page will be updated.
